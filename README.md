## Billing Badger

The Billing Badger was conceived at a UK Azure Group conference with Scott Guthrie keynoting at the Mermaid theatre in London.  Scott was looking for some random name as part of the demo, "Billy Badger" was shouted from the crowd and heard as "Billing Badger" - and thus the Badger was born.
