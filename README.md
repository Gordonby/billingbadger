## Badger Background

The Billing Badger was conceived at a UK Azure Group conference in Summer 2016.  Scott Guthrie was keynoting at the Mermaid theatre in London.  Scott was looking for some random name as part of the demo, "Billy Badger" was shouted from the crowd and heard as "Billing Badger" - and thus the Badger was born.

## Badger Objective

Publicising the joy of analysing Azure billing data.

Championing Microsoft Azure.

General annoyance of those who become familiar with the Badger.
